                        <p>
                            My philosophy towards design is simple: work alongside my clients in a collaborative partnership, to create highly memorable, impactful, and beautiful creative work that represents them and their goals. With that comes a little bit of an old and new school collision course, with influences from Paul Rand, George Lois, Stefan Sagmeister, Mike Monteiro, Von Glitchka, Aaron Draplin, and David Carson, with a good ol’ touch of Boston-bred charm.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I’ve worked with small businesses for the past several years, aside from my work with bigger brands and agencies alike. I co-founded a digital agency in Salem, MA called known.creative, LLC in the year 2014, and continued the same work with more varied clientele. Additionally, I teach Graphic Design II as an adjunct professor for my alma mater, Massachusetts College of Art & Design. I’m devoted to the craft of good design, and I always look for ways to push towards it.
